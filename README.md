🧠 Project Overview
Cognitron is an innovative AI-powered game built on Reddit's Devvit platform that transforms social discourse into an engaging puzzle experience. The game challenges players to identify and break cognitive biases within simulated subreddit echo chambers by crafting thoughtful interventions. Each level presents a unique "Cognitive Syndrome" – patterns of flawed thinking like "The Nostalgia Filter" in r/movies or "The Hype Cycle Trap" in r/technology – that players must overcome using critical thinking and persuasive communication skills.

🎯 Core Gameplay Mechanics
Players progress through multiple chambers, each representing a different subreddit with its own distinctive cognitive bias. The game features a sophisticated scoring system that rewards successful interventions with 100 points per chamber cleared, plus a 500-point bonus for completing all chambers. With only three attempts per chamber, players must carefully craft their responses to counter groupthink patterns. The built-in AI evaluation system provides immediate feedback on each intervention, helping players refine their critical thinking skills in real-time.

🏗️ Technical Architecture
Built with TypeScript and Reddit's Devvit framework, Cognitron leverages a modular architecture that separates game state management, AI analysis, and UI components. The game state system tracks player progress across multiple chambers while the mock AI engine provides realistic evaluation of player interventions without requiring external API calls. This makes the game fully functional for development and testing while maintaining the flexibility to integrate with real AI services when deployed.

🌟 Hackathon Innovation
Cognitron represents a novel approach to digital literacy education by gamifying the identification of cognitive biases in online spaces. Unlike traditional games, it uses real subreddit structures and common discourse patterns to create authentic challenges that mirror actual online interactions. The project demonstrates advanced integration with Reddit's developer platform while addressing the critical issue of echo chambers and groupthink in social media communities.

🚀 Development Status
The game currently features a complete core gameplay loop with three progressively difficult chambers, a functional scoring system, and a mock AI evaluation engine. The codebase is production-ready with proper TypeScript configuration, comprehensive game state management, and Reddit Devvit integration. Future enhancements could include real AI integration, additional chambers, multiplayer features, and more sophisticated bias detection algorithms.
